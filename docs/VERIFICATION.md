# Verification reports

## External preview preparation — 2026-10-12

Implementation commit `1d3beb8` adds configurable private PostgreSQL search path and
CA certificate options, with two isolated configuration tests (9 assertions).
Local gate passed: Pint, PHPStan (zero errors), 79 PHP tests / 385 assertions,
frontend formatting/lint, TypeScript, 3 UI tests and frontend build.
Two PostgreSQL concurrency tests were skipped locally. Both GitHub database jobs
completed successfully: [configuration CI](https://github.com/umar-vai/CRM/actions/runs/38168540383).

Hostinger hPanel shows the user-approved SSH key; authenticated, read-only SSH checks
confirm the CRM document root, writable private parent, explicit PHP 8.4.26 binary
and Composer 2.9.8. Default CLI PHP is 8.1.34; parent website PHP is 8.2, unchanged.
The PHP 8.4 CLI module list lacks `pdo_pgsql`. The CRM web root still contains only
the default hosting page. No application files or database changes were deployed.
SSH server identity was pinned using trust-on-first-use, not independently verified.

Not verified: CRM web PHP 8.4/driver setup, remote PostgreSQL TLS/authentication,
schema/role permissions, SMTP, live app flows, auto-deployment or release/DB recovery.
The read-only hosting checks and documentation update do not change application code.

## Team-management increment — 2026-10-11

Passed locally on Windows (PHP 8.4, Node 26):

- Invitation migration applied to the local development database.
- Complete `composer ci:check`: PHP formatting, PHPStan level 7 (zero errors), PHP tests,
  TypeScript, frontend formatting/lint and frontend unit tests.
- PHPUnit: **77 passed, 376 assertions; 2 PostgreSQL-only tests explicitly skipped** (79 total).
  This adds 23 team feature tests to the 54-test foundation.
- Three existing frontend translation/safety unit tests passed. These do not exercise the new React invitation UI.
- Production frontend build, including Team and Accept pages and generated Wayfinder routes/actions.
- Composer validation, Composer audit and npm audit passed; no reported dependency advisories at this time.
- `git diff --check` passed before the milestone commit.

PostgreSQL-specific integration coverage added:

- Two independent database connections: uncommitted real acceptance blocks another acceptance;
  committed retry is rejected, leaving one membership and one acceptance audit event.
- Uncommitted real role change blocks competing removal; stale removal after commit is rejected.

Local PostgreSQL is unavailable; these cases are not claimed as locally passing. The GitHub Actions
PostgreSQL/SQLite matrix runs on push. **Both database jobs completed successfully** for implementation
commit `2b7dae5`: [team-management CI run](https://github.com/umar-vai/CRM/actions/runs/38159158387).
The PostgreSQL job exercises the two connection/locking tests; SQLite explicitly skips them.
The latest local count includes five additional assertions for encrypted-session delivery, response
flash and no-store behavior added after that implementation commit; the full local CI suite was rerun.
The earlier foundation CI completed successfully: [foundation run](https://github.com/umar-vai/CRM/actions/runs/38151523906).

Not verified: browser E2E (including auth/verification fragment redirects, clipboard behavior and
React StrictMode interaction), accessibility/mobile UX, mail delivery, load/lock-contention tests,
backup restoration, production rollout/rollback, external integrations or billing.
Manual invitation sharing is implemented; automatic invitation email sending and ownership transfer are not.

## Foundation verification — 2026-10-11

### Passed locally

- SQLite migrations on a new local database.
- PHP syntax checks and Pint formatting/check.
- PHPStan level 7: zero errors, no suppressions or baseline.
- PHPUnit: 54 tests passed, 203 assertions. 14 are workspace/CRM/security regression tests.
- TypeScript `tsc --noEmit`.
- Frontend formatting and type-aware lint: no warnings/errors.
- Three Node unit tests for Bengali/English translation and prototype-key lookup safety.
- Production frontend build, including generated Wayfinder routes/actions.
- Composer validate --strict.
- Composer audit and npm audit: no reported advisories at the time of verification.
- git diff --check.

### Fixes discovered during verification

- Restricted account closure while workspace memberships/business history exist.
- Preserved logout-before-delete behavior to avoid remember-token persistence re-creating a deleted model.
- Membership middleware now checks an explicit boolean condition.
- Settings redirect is GET-only; avoids an unused generated all-method redirect helper with an unsupported HTTP QUERY method.
- Formatter's transitive tinypool dependency is overridden to patched 2.1.2.

### Not yet verified

- PostgreSQL runtime/concurrency locally; CI provides a SQLite/PostgreSQL matrix.
- Browser end-to-end flows, mobile/assistive-technology audit.
- Load testing, disaster recovery, queue tenancy, external integrations.
- Live production infrastructure or billing.

These checks establish a development foundation, not certification that the platform is production ready.
Dependency audit results are time-specific and should be rerun in future sessions.
